ed7a1a27a10eb858ba902bf7ebec051c,These mesmerizing photos from female divers take you to the depths of oceans," My first dive was during a family trip to Phuket, Thailand, in 2015. I fell in love with the surrealness of breathing underwater while surrounded by marine life, but I knew almost nothing about the craft. Four years later, I discovered the Facebook group “Girls that Scuba,” a place where I could connect with other female divers. Through the help and recommendations from other members, I finally completed my open water diver certification. [Where can Americans travel to in the Caribbean?] Girls that Scuba is more than just a social media group, though — it is the world’s largest female dive community, with nearly 50,000 members. Founded by British dive master Sarah Richard in 2016, the group was created to help bridge the gender gap in the professional diving industry. Throughout the pandemic, members have shared experiences on dives and offered support through a time when diving has become difficult. So we asked Girls that Scuba members to share their favorite dives before and during the pandemic and where they can’t wait to return.

(Louise Nott)  Based in: Sydney; Years of experience: 5 When thinking about diving in Australia, what first come to mind are the clear, warm, tropical waters of the Great Barrier Reef. Unfortunately, because of travel restrictions during the pandemic, exploring the vibrant reefs that are home to Nemo are out of the question. With the easing of restrictions, I have been fortunate to explore some of the dive sites in the lesser-known Great Southern Reef. I have recently spent some time diving around Bass Point in Shellharbour. There are a number of small dive sites around the reserve that showcase the beauty of the cool-water temperate reefs. From small pygmy pipehorses to gentle grey nurse sharks, the southern reef is truly a biodiversity hot spot.

(Jennifer Hui Cheung)  Based in: California; Years of experience: 5 My love for Indonesia ignited in 2016 when I first decided to dive Komodo National Park after learning that the island country is in the heart of the Coral Triangle. The region covers 1.6 percent of the ocean but has 76 percent of the world’s known coral species and 37 percent of the world’s reef fish. From the tiniest frogfish to the largest manta, Indonesia has it all. It’s an underwater photographer’s dream. The jaw-dropping color, density and variety of fish life as well as the healthy hard and soft coral make it incredibly difficult to end each dive; I never want to come up.

(Jolanda de Hooge)  Based in: Amsterdam; Years of experience: 27 If it weren’t for covid-19, I would have been diving at Bonaire in the Caribbean. Now, staying home in the Netherlands, I’ve rediscovered diving in the sweet lake near the village of Vinkeveen, close to Amsterdam. It is colder and a much greener underwater world than the tropical areas, but full of pikes, little lobsters and perches. It’s my favorite close-to-home dive spot.     Ellen Fulton    A southern stingray in Bimini, an island in the Bahamas, in December 2019. (Ellen Fulton)  Based in: Florida; Years of experience: 5 The Bahamas’ crystal-clear water, full of graceful, beautiful sharks and stingrays, was an eternal highlight. Less than a mile off the coast, in about 30 feet of water, we knelt on the sandy white ocean floor with regulators in our mouths as we rhythmically breathed, preparing to see the most majestic creatures we had ever seen.    One of the great hammerhead sharks Fulton dove with in Bimini. (Ellen Fulton)  Within minutes, our hearts began to race as we witnessed three great hammerheads swimming around and over us with ease, followed by tiger, bull and nurse sharks. Closer to shore, we had many close encounters with southern stingrays. Bimini, Bahamas, is a place to which my wife, and I will definitely return once the threat of covid-19 is no longer an issue.

(Nicole Sangid)  Based in: North Carolina; Years of experience: 3 I first traveled to Bonaire, nicknamed “Diver’s Paradise,” in February 2019 as my first week-long dive trip, and I immediately fell in love with the island. It’s easily drivable from one end to the other and is known for its extensive list of shore diving sites, which allowed me the freedom to dive as much as I wanted each day. I couldn’t believe how vibrant and lively the coral reefs were. Each dive was marked by thousands of colorful fish and corals and occasionally other residents, including squids, sea turtles, eels, sea horses and octopuses.

(Megan Crabtree)  Based in: California; Years of experience: 2 I was lucky enough to dive in Mexico, the Red Sea, Cocos Island, Iceland and Canada before the pandemic, but I’ve found that the kelp forests along California’s coastline are what really hold endless fascination for me. These ecosystems are home to thousands of amazing species including abalone, sea otters, ocean sunfish (mola mola) and great white sharks. Many people fear these sites because of cold-water temperatures, but in my opinion, the opportunity to see and interact with this wildlife is well worth the additional effort and gear, especially while worldwide shutdowns have limited travel.

(Tricie Chua)  Based in: California; Years of experience: 6 As a macro enthusiast, I was pleasantly surprised by all the fun small stuff to find. Each dive is like a treasure hunt — sea slugs, blennies, arrowhead crabs, countless types of fish, anemones, lobsters and octopuses. Some people enjoy the slow pace, while others preferred currents and larger animals. I enjoy seeing big things too, and on my second day diving, I got my fill of sea lions. Definitely a bucket list item; they are incredibly inquisitive and feisty.     Ivana Savvidou    A school of baby squid in Protaras, Cyprus, in August.

This is why Nemesis Wreck in Protaras is a very pleasant surprise. It is a wreck sunk in December 2013 in a government attempt to create an artificial reef. It is full of fish, colorful nudibranch and amazing sea sponges often visited by turtles, rays and squid. Diving the wreck gives you a hope for the Mediterranean Sea.     Stefanie Loher    Soft coral at the Palawan Islands in the Philippines in February. (Stefanie Loher)  Based in: Munich; Years of experience: 1.5 I lived and worked in El Nido, Philippines, for five months. I totally fell in love with all macro life (most favorites are nudibranches).

(Shireen Shipman)  Based in: California; Years of experience: 2 The kelp forest ecosystem [in the Coronado Islands in Mexico] is full of life from the sea bed to the ocean surface. There are colorful sea slugs (nudibranches), octopuses, rockfish and small sharks hidden in the kelp of the sea floor. The larger animals, like sevengill sharks, giant black sea bass, sea turtles, bat rays, sea lions and harbor seals can be found swimming through the higher levels of the kelp forest. I have been lucky enough to regularly dive in it in San Diego, once the shelter-in-place orders were lifted.     Shaylyn Potter    A labidiaster sea star in the Antarctic Peninsula. (Shaylyn Potter)  Based in: Oregon; Years of experience: 12 While diving in Antarctica, I’m often navigating uncharted sites — seeing things that few humans may have ever seen before. The excitement of discovery in one of Earth’s most remote and hostile environments makes Antarctica my favorite place to dive; I feel like an explorer.    A plethora of echinoderms in the South Shetland Islands in Antarctica. (Shaylyn Potter)  Diving among massive icebergs and in water that is below the freezing point can be intense. It requires both physical and mental strength. Though polar expedition diving is more challenging and extreme than standard resort diving, it’s the drive to overcome these challenges and the possibility of seeing rare wildlife that keeps me coming back for more.

d98c5b790929eca2ad963af139d38380,Bali won’t allow tourists until 2021. These 4 destinations will probably follow.," Even as many nations begin to lift their coronavirus travel restrictions, vacationers considering a gamble on late-2020 trips abroad might want to reconsider — or at least make sure to book a very flexible ticket. Some destinations have recently made moves to extend their tourism shutdowns. Bali’s shift away from reopening this year, in favor of only domestic tourism, was announced this week. Other international destinations have signaled similar plans. Why? Hospitality experts say extended border closures might be a smart move for the survival of certain tourist-frequented destinations. “As countries open and close again due to [covid-19] cases … these destinations might be thinking ‘Let’s just wait until the storm is over,’ ” said John Niser, director of the International School of Hospitality and Tourism Management (ISHTM) at Fairleigh Dickinson University. “Reopening and then closing again due to an outbreak … it’s totally unpredictable.” Nations that have reopened in 2020 only to return to limiting tourists in some way include the Bahamas, which closed its borders to Americans after coronavirus cases began to rise in July. (It later reopened with 14-day quarantines in place.) The government of Hungary, which has been open to E.U. tourists and citizens of some other low-risk countries, announced Friday that it was closing its borders on Sept. 1 amid a rise in cases. Here’s which destinations have signaled or outright announced they won’t be allowing tourists until 2021. Bali, Indonesia    A tourist sunbathes on a Bali beach in July. (Firdia Lisnawati/AP)  The Indonesian island of Bali recently announced that, contrary to its previously planned reopening date of Sept. 11, it will not allow international tourists until 2021. Instead, the island is allowing only domestic travel in hopes of supporting the local economy while avoiding a rise in covid-19 cases. In its third phase of reopening protocol, Indonesia’s tourism board announced in a news release that “Bali [will] not be able to open up to foreign tourists as previously planned” and will “extend the travel ban until at least the end of 2020.” The Indonesian tourism board also noted that Bali’s main airport, which is closed to international arrivals, is instead seeing thousands of domestic tourism arrivals per day. [Cruise lines are already canceling sailings into 2021] Niser says that smaller tourism destinations made up primarily of small businesses have an added incentive to stay closed off: Small-business owners in tourist-frequented areas carry less debt than the big chains, so “it might be cheaper to stay closed.” Thailand    A tourist dines at a restaurant on the typically bustling Khaosan Road in Bangkok on Monday. (Rungroj Yongrit/EPA-EFE/Shutterstock)  Thailand recently echoed the intention to delay reopening, with Chattan Kunjara Na Ayudhya of Thailand’s tourism authority commenting in a webinar earlier this month: “I see no signal from the government that the country will open this year.” The country does have an October pilot program in place to allow some international tourists into Phuket, but only if the visitors agree to quarantine for two weeks upon arrival at a designated resort. Australia and New Zealand    A woman walks by the Sydney Opera House on Aug. 17. (Brook Mitchell/Getty Images)  Larger nations are also hinting that they are unlikely to reopen in 2020, with Qantas chief executive Alan Joyce recently telling investors that he predicts Australians will not be able to fly internationally until 2021, according to the New Zealand Herald. Australia and New Zealand officials have spoken about allowing a potential travel bubble between the two nations if covid-19 levels remain controlled, but New Zealand is still imposing a complete ban on almost all visitors. New Zealand’s tourism board told The Washington Post via email: “It is not known at this time when the border is likely to re-open, but the health and safety of New Zealanders will be at the forefront of any decision made by the New Zealand Government.” Australia’s tourism minister Simon Birmingham said in April during an appearance on “News Breakfast,” an Australian morning program, that citizens shouldn’t plan on being able to travel internationally come December. In August, he stressed on the same show that Australians should support the tourism industry by booking domestic stays and experiences. South Africa    Rangers greet each other while taking domestic tourists on a guided safari tour at the Dinokeng Game Reserve outside Pretoria, South Africa, on Aug. 7. (Michele Spatari/AFP/Getty Images)  Another large country that heavily depends on tourism, South Africa has the most coronavirus cases in all of Africa, with 618,000 total cases. The peak of new daily cases hit in late July, after strict lockdowns and curfews imposed early in the pandemic were lifted in May. Sisa Ntshona, the chief executive of South African Tourism, told the BBC amid the outbreak last month, “I don’t foresee any international tourism happening within this calendar year.” Protests in South Africa have become commonplace as a response to the impact of covid-19. The Institute for Security Studies, also known as ISS Africa, said in a July analysis: “The pandemic has exposed socio-economic weaknesses resulting from poor policy implementation and a fundamental failure of political leadership.” The South Africa-based organization notes that an average of eight protests occurred every day in July, which is the most the country has seen in a month since 2013. Niser, of ISHTM, says he expects some nations to see similar unrest if they continue to remain closed to the tourism that they depend on, despite the threat tourism poses to public health. Outside of businesses like hotels, there are individual workers to think about, such as taxi drivers, guides and tour operators, he says, who might not have work until the crowds return. “I predict some big social unrest in the Caribbean and in Africa, South Africa in particular, and some countries in Asia,” Niser says. “Empty pots can be more dangerous than tanks in the street, so to speak.” Read more: An American allegedly broke Canada’s visitor ban — twice.

7fd26dd2a4a811526ffe5b304986536e,"How to choose, prep and use all those summer cucumbers"," Each family has its own lore, often-repeated stories and catchphrases. One that I’ll always remember, although told to me secondhand, is from my oldest niece, who while at her great-grandparents’ farm had a simple request: “More ’cumbers, please.” My husband’s grandmother tends to keep a bowl of sliced cucumbers in salted water or pickle brine around, and those are what the precocious tot was requesting. We may be saying the same thing now, when markets are awash in cucumbers. This is the season when they are most appreciated as a cooling and refreshing ingredient. Here are tips to help you pick the best cucumbers and figure out how to use them. Varieties. If you’re trying to decide which type will taste superior in your recipe, don’t overthink it. “Subtle differences among types aside, all cucumbers more or less taste alike,” says Deborah Madison in “The New Vegetarian Cooking for Everyone.” That being said, there are other considerations — size, texture, water content — that might affect your choice. In “Ruffage,” chef and farmer Abra Berens gives the rundown.  English: This salad favorite is moist with small seeds, and a thin, tender skin. Chop or slice, and eat. Easy. American: These are probably what you see in your mind’s eye when you envision a cucumber. They’re shorter and plumper, with a thicker, bumpy skin that’s not always pleasant to eat. Berens suggests going with a medium size. Too small and they lack flavor, too big and their thicker skin and larger seeds make them unpalatable. These tend to hold up well in the type of casual refrigerator pickles my husband’s grandmother — and Berens’s mother — have on hand. Pickling: You’ll likely see bins of these at your farmers market. Berens notes that their size and drier flesh make them ideal, for, yes, pickling. Less water in the flesh means the brine won’t be diluted by it and also wards off the potential for rot. Persian: Hands down, these are my favorite, the ones that earned the moniker “crunchy cucumbers” from my son. You, however, may also see them at your market under the name Manar. They’re on the smaller side, with bumpy ridged skin that is just fine to eat. Berens says these are good for preserving, too. Lemon: They are round and yellow like the citrus they’re named after. “They have a moderately tough-textured skin with a slight tang in the bite,” Berens says. “You can use them anywhere you’d use another cucumber.”     (Tom McCorkle for The Washington Post; food styling by Lisa Cherkasky for The Washington Post)  Buying and storing. Berens says that cucumbers you’re buying should have rigid skin with no wrinkles, which can indicate age or that the cells of the fruit are broken. They should be a healthy green, not yellow, although you may see pale spots where the cucumber was not exposed to the sun. Keep them in a cool, dark spot; the refrigerator, inside a plastic bag, is the best place for the longest storage. If you buy cucumbers that have already been chilled, keep them that way, as the cells can be ruptured by temperature changes. Prepping. Madison’s general rule is that you don’t need to peel cucumbers with thin, unwaxed and unsprayed skins. If you want some, but not all, of the skin for texture or visual appeal, try peeling strips for a striped effect, which is especially appealing on slices. Older cucumbers and certain varieties will have bigger seeds, but removing them is a matter of personal preference. In “Salt Fat Acid Heat,” Samin Nosrat recommends getting rid of any larger than a peppercorn. My preferred method is to halve the cucumber lengthwise and then use a small spoon, teaspoon or melon baller to scrape them out. Salting cucumbers, Madison says, can help draw out excess moisture for a crisper result. Berens is a little more cautious, noting that salting too far in advance can make dishes watery or the cucumbers rubbery. If you do salt, drain the water and blot the pieces. One I’d never heard: Madison recommends rubbing the cut sides of cucumbers together until they foam to counteract bitterness and elicit a sweeter flavor. Again, here’s Berens: “I haven’t found this to make a bit of difference, but it is kind of fun and worth a shot if you taste bitterness in cucumbers.” How to use them. There’s not much reason to do anything to cucumbers other than eat them as is. Snack on them. Toss them in a salad. Then experiment with them in a non-green salad, a drink or a soup. My colleague Kari Sonde had an excellent roundup last year that will walk you through a bunch of different strategies. Please check it out. [Tips and recipes to make the most of your cucumbers] Kari does briefly touch on cooking cucumbers. It’s unexpected, but Berens, too, is a fan. She recommends charring them, crediting her friend, food blogger Tim Mazurek, for introducing her to the concept. First, you need to blot the cucumbers as dry as you can. Leave them in bigger pieces with the skin intact so they don’t fall apart. Sear in a very hot pan, aiming for a very dark crust and a somewhat soft texture to the flesh. One approach Kari’s piece didn’t cover: Smashing. Sure, it’s therapeutic, but it also results in a mix of softer and snappy textures and chunks that are attractively ragged. See Chicken Yakitori With Smashed Cucumber Salad from Tanya Sichynsky, via our Meal Plan of Action newsletter. You can take a completely different approach and thinly slice them into delicate ribbons. As far as flavors, cucumber naturally pairs well with dairy, as in raita or tzatziki (Indian and Greek yogurt dips, respectively), doogh (a Persian yogurt drink you can find variations on elsewhere) and soup. Its natural cooling tendency makes cucumber a handy foil to spice as well. Need a few recipes? Check out these possibilities from our archives.

6b4815a8020a8616d5604635c0fb20e5,Colorblind travelers can take in the true colors of fall thanks to these viewfinders," For people with colorblindness, fall foliage lacks its renowned rich hues. Tennessee is trying to change that, one autumn at a time. In 2017, the state’s tourism board began installing scenic viewfinders with EnChroma lenses that alleviate red-green colorblindness in 12 lookouts around the state. “There are over 13 million colorblind Americans who never get to experience something as beautiful as fall colors,” says Mark Ezell, commissioner of the Tennessee Department of Tourist Development. “We created 12 scenic viewers located in some of Tennessee’s most picturesque locations so that they could, for the first time, fully appreciate that beauty.” Ezell says many people with colorblindness have an emotional experience when they look through the special viewfinders. [Fall used to be considered the offseason for travel. Not this year.] “Red was the biggest difference. I mean, I can’t describe it,” Tennessee local Lauren Van Lew told the Associated Press in 2019 after using one of the viewfinders at Mount Harrison. “It’s the most beautiful thing I’ve ever seen in my life. That red, it’s just gorgeous. It’s incredible.” And in a video from TNVacation, a man looking through a viewfinder for the first time is overcome with emotion as he says: “I’m glad to have seen it. I just wish I’d seen this all my life. Kind of like what I would imagine the difference between here and heaven.” The coronavirus pandemic initially thwarted plans to install more of the viewfinders throughout the state. However, Ezell says Cares Act funding may get the expansion back on track. “We had budget challenges,” Ezell says. “But it’s back on our list to try to move quickly and work with EnChroma, as we’re not only upgrading those lenses but [adding] some sites.” Travelers can find the existing viewfinders using an interactive map on the state’s tourism board website. The viewfinders are placed all across the state, so Ezell recommends that colorblind travelers find the ones most conveniently located to them.    A man reacts to seeing fall foliage for the first time in full color. (Tennessee Department of Tourist Development)  Despite the pandemic, Ezell thinks fall travelers will be drawn to Tennessee this year because the state has an abundance of outdoor attractions. “It’s why we are so blessed in Tennessee,” Ezell says. “Whether it’s our 50,000 miles of streams or our hundreds of thousands of acres of lakes or our mountains, we’ve got 56 state parks. … There’s plenty of room to spread out with a natural social distancing.” The hospitality industry has also reworked operations to welcome back tourists safely this fall. “Whether somebody is choosing a cabin or a hotel or a campground, so many businesses across Tennessee have worked on those key things like extra sanitation, making sure people and employees are wearing masks, doing temperature checks and then using social distancing,” Ezell says. “We really feel good about the environment that we’re being able to encourage people to travel safely.” [This video of a boy seeing color for the first time has raised thousands of dollars for colorblind students] According to the nonprofit organization Colour Blind Awareness, approximately 300 million people worldwide have some kind of colorblindness, from deuteranomaly — a reduced sensitivity to green light — to monochromacy — an absence of color completely. Other initiatives are in place to bring colorful experiences to those with colorblindness. Some museums and libraries in the United States, including the Museum of Contemporary Art in Denver, the Georgia O’Keeffe Museum, the California Academy of Sciences and the St. Johns County Public Library System in St. Augustine, Fla., stock EnChroma glasses for visitors to wear during their visit. Tennessee is the only state with designated fall foliage colorblind viewfinders, but Ezell hopes the concept spreads elsewhere. “We would love for this to be available across the country if it helps folks,” he says.

Consider the fruit crisp or crumble. Fresh fruit is cut up and baked under a crumbly, cookie-like topping made of flour, sugar and butter (or another fat). Some say a crisp will always have oats, and crisps and crumbles might have nuts in the mix as well, for extra crunch. The flexibility of the common, homey dessert is one of its assets; its only essential ingredient is fruit. [Whether it’s crisp or crumble, three steps will make it better] Apple is always a popular option in the fall, but the lazy days of late summer call for fillings of jammy plums, ripe berries, fragrant peaches and plump cherries. Here are six of our favorites from the Recipe Finder. Summer Fruit Crumble, above. From plums and peaches to blueberries and cherries, any summer fruit can get tossed into this crumble.

ce307373c9a78c6df41eba1980c7deb6,"An American allegedly broke Canada’s visitor ban — twice. Now he could face a $570,000 fine."," Banff National Park in Alberta is famous for its sweeping alpine views and the turquoise waters of Lake Louise. But a visit to Canada’s oldest national park is probably not worth a fine up to $570,000 ($750,000 Canadian dollars) and jail time. That’s what one American tourist faces after the Royal Canadian Mounted Police say he breached quarantine to visit the area in late June. Canada’s U.S.-border closure has prevented nonessential American visitors from entering since March. John Pennington, 40, of Kentucky was first cited and then arrested when police say he was twice found to be in violation of Canada’s provincial health orders after entering from Alaska, Cpl. Tammy Keibel told The Washington Post. [CDC drops 14-day self-quarantine recommendation for international and out-of-state travelers] Pennington was staying at Banff’s Rimrock Resort Hotel, where staff reported his presence to the RCMP. Police initially issued him a ticket for about $900 and ordered him to stay in his hotel room until he left Canada the following day — but the next morning Pennington’s license plate was spotted at nearby Sulphur Mountain’s gondola. At the mountain, Pennington was arrested for breaching Canada’s Quarantine Act, which can carry a fine up to $570,000 and up to six months in jail. He was released and escorted out of Canada and is scheduled to appear in court in Canmore, Alberta, in November. “In Alberta, we’ve issued 21 public health tickets so far in 2020. Ten of the 21 were issued to Americans, and all of those 10 were issued in Banff National Park,” Keibel says. She notes that the park’s trails and other outdoor spaces have remained “quite busy” despite the coronavirus border closure and that Banff National Park has instituted an outdoor mask order. [What to know about getting tested for the coronavirus to travel] Canada’s coronavirus travel restrictions state that Americans are permitted to cross the border into Canada if they’re driving straight through to the contiguous United States — a rule known as the Alaska loophole — but are not permitted to stop for tourist activities. Americans en route to Alaska are now required to use the most direct route and display vehicle hang tags denoting when they’ll be exiting Canada at a designated border exit point, but Keibel says that rule was instituted later in the summer after Pennington’s June arrest. The only other person the Alberta RCMP has issued a public health ticket to in 2020 was a Canadian citizen returning from abroad who broke quarantine requirements, Keibel says. The border closure preventing Americans from visiting Canada for tourism are in place at least until Sept. 21.

273999dcc602433511ce7830e88aa235,This coconut rice with salmon and cilantro sauce deserves a spot in your regular recipe rotation," Overview Ingredients Steps  Overview One of the most gratifying experiences I can have as a food writer occurs when readers send an email to tell me that a dish I’ve shared in Dinner in Minutes is now part of their regular recipe rotation. I do a little happy dance in my desk chair. Inevitably, that recipe already is on repeat in my own kitchen because it comes together quickly and is delicious, but also has that little something extra — a surprisingly bold flavor, a touch of elegance or a sauce or component that I find myself carrying over to other dishes. [As a milk, a water or simply shredded, coconut adds joy to these 5 recipes] People who love to cook inevitably talk about food — a lot. If we make something delicious, we have to tell someone about it, to bring them a taste or at least share the recipe. So, it wasn’t surprising that right after I started at The Post in December, my new colleague Olga Massov shared a recipe with me that she frequently served to her family: Coconut Rice With Salmon and Cilantro Sauce from “The Kitchen Shelf” by Rosie Reynolds and Eve O’Sullivan (Phaidon, 2016). Scale and get a printer-friendly version of the recipe here. Olga lent me the cookbook, and as I read through the recipe, I thought this little number checks all the boxes. Yes, it has three parts: the rice, the fish and the sauce, but each of those parts is easily executed. The cookbook’s full title includes this phrase: “Take a few pantry essentials, add two ingredients and make everyday eating extraordinary.” The idea is that you use common pantry ingredients with just a couple of fresh additions — in this case cilantro and fish — and you can put a scrumptious meal on the table. Although it was written four years ago, the cookbook fits in perfectly with the way we are cooking during the pandemic — from our pantries, with minimal extra shopping. [Help dinner go swimmingly with these 8 salmon recipes] The cookbook authors offer time-saving tips. For example, in this recipe, they suggest two ways to cook the salmon. The faster and easier way is to steam the fillets atop the rice as it cooks. If, however, you prefer a crispy salmon skin, you can allow the rice to cook on its own and pan-fry your salmon. For me, however, the salmon is the least interesting thing here. The rice cooked with softened onion, garlic and a pinch of sugar in full-fat coconut milk is creamy and divine on its own. The cilantro sauce — a whole bunch of the herb leaves whirred in a food processor with a syrup made of water, sugar and crushed red pepper flakes — goes over the rice, but I could just eat that up with a spoon. When I realized that I have now made this dish several times and have made the rice and cilantro sauce to go with other kinds of fish, broiled shrimp and pan-fried skirt steak, I knew it was time to share it with you, too.   Ingredients FOR THE RICE AND SALMON 1 tablespoon olive oil 1 medium onion (about 4 ounces), finely diced 1 clove garlic, finely minced 1 1/2 cups white basmati rice, rinsed until the water runs clear 1 (14-ounce) can full-fat coconut milk 1/4 teaspoon kosher salt 1/2 teaspoon granulated sugar 4 (3- to 4-ounce) skin-on salmon fillets FOR THE SAUCE Scant 1/2 cup water 1 1/2 tablespoons granulated sugar 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt, plus more to taste 1/2 teaspoon crushed red pepper, plus more as needed for serving 1 large bunch fresh cilantro, leaves and tender stems, coarsely chopped 4 lime wedges, for serving (optional)   Steps Step 1 Make the rice: In a large, lidded skillet or pan, heat the oil over medium heat until shimmering. Add the onion and cook, stirring occasionally, until it softens and just starts to brown, 8 to 10 minutes. Add the garlic and cook until fragrant, 1 to 2 minutes. Add the rice and stir to coat it in the oil. Add the coconut milk, then half-fill the empty can with water and add it to the pan. Add the salt and sugar, bring to a boil, then reduce the heat to low so the mixture is at a simmer and cover the pan. Cook for 5 minutes, then uncover the pan. Carefully place the salmon fillets on top of the rice, re-cover the pot and cook until the rice is just tender, the salmon cooked, and the liquid has been absorbed, about 5 minutes more. (If the rice is not tender, but the salmon is cooked, removed the fish, re-cover the pot and continue cooking for a few minutes more.) Step 2 Make the sauce: While the rice and salmon are cooking, in a small pan over high heat, combine the water, sugar, salt and crushed red pepper and bring to a boil. Lower the heat to medium and simmer the sauce until slightly reduced and syrupy, about 5 minutes, then remove from the heat. Place the cilantro in a food processor and pulse to chop. Gradually pour in the syrup and pulse the cilantro until very finely chopped, and the sauce is combined. Taste and adjust the seasonings; the sauce should be slightly sweet, with a hint of heat. Add more crushed red pepper, sugar or salt, as needed. Step 3 To serve, transfer the salmon off the rice to a plate. Gently stir the rice and divide the rice across 4 plates. Top with a salmon fillet and drizzle the sauce over. Sprinkle with additional crushed red pepper flakes, if desired, and serve with a wedge of lime, if using. Step 4 Alternative for the salmon: If you prefer a pan-seared salmon fillet, cook it separately from the rice. Season the fish with salt and pepper. Heat a large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat until a drop of water sizzles when it hits the surface. Add the fillets, skin side up, and cook until just lightly browned, 1 to 2 minutes. Turn the fillets over and reduce the heat to medium. Cook until the salmon looks almost cooked through, 2 to 4 minutes; you can check using the tip of a sharp knife. You should see a slightly darker center. The cooking time will vary depending on the thickness of the fillet. With either fish preparation, if you prefer to serve the salmon without the skin, it is easier to remove it after cooking the fish.

In the meantime, let’s take the rest of the summer to focus on a different genre — cooling, creamy custard and ice cream pies.

a809f589aad6bdf10da6ae2a82c727fd,"This giant, puffy Dutch baby, topped with fresh fruit, is a great way to start — or end — your day"," Overview Ingredients Steps  Overview One of the saving graces of this pandemic for my son has been his magnetic tiles. He puts them together and takes them apart, as often and in as many ways as he wants. I feel the same way about milk, flour, eggs and butter: Four basic ingredients that can be mixed and matched and varied to create so many dishes. That’s especially true for pancakes, which I’ve been on a bit of a kick for lately. Though I prefer buttermilk for my traditional fluffy stack, with that quartet you can pull together everything from thin crepes to thick, fluffy kaiserschmarrn. Vary the liquid, the leavening and the proportions, and you can play around with the texture and height that you prefer. Too many pancakes? Not in my book. [Kaiserschmarrn is the most beautiful, delicious mess of a pancake you’ll ever make, and eat] Now I have one more to share with you. It’s a Dutch baby, a puffy baked pancake that requires minimal time, ingredients and effort. You’re probably more used to seeing this morning staple come out of a skillet, but I couldn’t help figuratively slapping my forehead in a “no duh!” moment when I saw the large-format one peeking out of the pages at me in Edd Kimber’s new “One Tin Bakes,” which publishes here in the United States on Sept. 1. Kimber, the winner of the never-aired-in-the-States first season of “The Great British Bake Off,” makes everything in this delightful, well-written cookbook (his fourth) in a 9-by-13 tin. It’s nothing fancy, a workhorse, yet when you put something as simple as this 5-minute batter in and bake it until the edges dramatically puff, you’ll be rewarded with something that looks, and tastes, absolutely impressive. The recipe takes well to your choice of fruit. I tested with fresh berries, sliced peaches and diced apples and liked them all. Based on personal experience (that son demanding all the fresh berries), I wouldn’t recommend frozen fruit, as it bled and make the pancake soggy, though I did still enjoy it. If you prefer, you can bake the pancake first and then add the fruit, to achieve a thinner, drier bottom. [13 sweet and savory pancake recipes for every kind of mood] This recipe is going into my regular breakfast rotation to jazz up what otherwise might be a meh morning. No one would complain if you served it as dessert, either, in which case you may want to drizzle with heavy cream or serve with ice cream. As long as you have the four main ingredients on hand, you’ll be ready to make it whenever, however. Recipe notes: The recipe calls for the tin to be placed in the oven while it preheats, which helps generate the signature puff. Some manufacturers, including Pyrex, do not recommend doing this with their baking dishes. A metal tin is ideal. The batter needs to rest 20 minutes before baking. Scale and get a printer-friendly, desktop version of the recipe here.   Ingredients 4 large eggs 2 tablespoons granulated sugar Scant 1 cup (125 grams) all-purpose flour 1 cup (240 milliliters) whole or reduced-fat milk 2 teaspoons vanilla extract 1/4 teaspoon fine sea salt 2 tablespoons (28 grams) unsalted butter 10 1/2 ounces (300 grams) fresh fruit of your choice, such as mixed berries, sliced peaches or diced apple Confectioners' sugar, for dusting   Steps Step 1 Position a baking rack in the middle of the oven and preheat to 425 degrees. Place an empty 9-inch-by-13-inch pan on the rack while you prepare the batter. Step 2 In a large bowl, whisk together the eggs and sugar for 30 seconds, until the sugar dissolves, then add the flour, milk, vanilla and salt, whisking to form a smooth, thin batter. Set aside for 20 minutes while the oven heats up. Step 3 Carefully remove the hot pan from the oven and add the butter, swirling the pan until it melts and coats the bottom. Pour in the batter, sprinkle the fruit on top and bake for about 20 minutes, or until puffed and golden. The pancake will begin to deflate almost as soon as it comes out of the oven, but will largely retain its puffy edges. Dust the pancake with the confectioners’ sugar and serve immediately.

b9628e11db4b47ce6403e7a9f633943b,How to preserve summer tomatoes so you can enjoy them all year long," Overview Ingredients Steps  Overview When I planted Mortgage Lifter, Mr. Stripey, German Red Strawberry, Early Girl and Roma seedlings in my backyard, I had dreams of filling baskets with sun-ripened tomatoes. I imagined jars of canned tomatoes cooling on the kitchen counter as well as a winter filled with a sense of self-sufficiency and just a little bit of gloating. Instead, the squirrels and I have had our battles. There will be no moments of happy homesteading. I harvest one or two tomatoes a day and the little monsters snack on the rest. If squirrels, bunnies or groundhogs have invaded your garden, take heart: It’s been a banner year for small farmers. Summer tomatoes are abundant, delicious and at a good price. It is a great time to start a tomato canning tradition. [This reliable jam recipe will let you savor the best berries and stone fruit year-round] Tomatoes are the most useful ingredient in my pantry, particularly through the winter when many cold-weather recipes call for a can of them. In my dinner rotation, sauces, stews, soups, enchiladas, pizzas and parms all use them. It’s such a relief to give up lugging home heavy cans from the grocery store and, instead, reach into the pantry for my own home-preserved version. If you’re new to canning, here’s some advice: Select tomatoes that are ripe or slightly underripe, cutting out any black spots or bruises. Slicing tomatoes such as Brandywine, Beefsteak and Big Red are the most commonly preserved, while Roma tomatoes are another excellent choice — all are meaty varieties with thick walls and small seed sacks. Heirloom tomatoes are fine but often have a higher water content and may result in a watery flavor once canned. Red tomatoes are prettiest in the jar, but a mixed bunch of every shape, color and size also works well, with the exception of grape or cherry tomatoes, which are too hard to peel. Clear the counters and make room. This is a big, messy job that starts with placing the largest pots, pans and bowls into an assembly line and ends with cleaning the kitchen. Remove seeds and skins. They may turn bitter in the jar. Remove the skin by blanching: Slice an X through the base and dunk in boiling water, and the peel will lift off in satisfying swaths. Plunge your fingers into the cells, scooping and discarding the seeds and gel. Then tear the remaining tomato flesh into large pieces. [If you put up, don’t shut up. Talk to the farmers who are growing your food.] Crush the tomato pulp. Crushed canned tomatoes can separate into liquids and solids in the jar. This does not affect the tomatoes’ usefulness, but it isn’t as pretty. I crush, smash, tear and combine the pulpy and watery tomato meat until it’s a cohesive, chunky mixture, then begin cooking those crushed tomatoes — about a quart at a time — as I continue peeling, seeding and tearing the rest. Essentially, I’m a one-person band concurrently banging the cymbal, playing the harmonica and fiddling. This is the big work of tomato canning and shouldn’t be rushed. Adjust acidity. Safe water bath canning relies on preserving foods with dependably high acidity, measured as pH. Because tomatoes have a wide-ranging pH, bottled lemon juice or citric acid is used to adjust the mixture to a safe level. Citric acid is a shelf-stable synthetic version of the naturally occurring compound found in citrus. Salt is not needed for preservation but may be added for flavor. Use only kosher or fine sea salt, not iodized, which can add a metallic aftertaste. [Water Bath Canning Step-by-Step] Use what you have. The greatest yield will come from blanched, peeled and seeded, hand-crushed tomatoes. Canning does not require special equipment. It is possible to preserve pint jars in a large stockpot, fashion a rack for the bottom of the canner from a cake rack and to use a cooler for an ice bath. Two tools I highly recommend: a jar funnel and a rubber-coated jar lifter. I’ve used a measuring cup to add ingredients to jars, and I’ve McGyver’d a tool to help lift hot jars from the boiling water by twisting rubber bands around the ends of kitchen tongs, but the two low-cost tools are safer to use. Veteran canners rely on special kitchen tools to make the preserving process easier. For example, a food mill processes quartered, cooked-until-tender tomatoes, removing seeds and skins for a smooth sauce. The near-legendary, budget-busting Squeezo is a grinder that removes peels and seeds and melds the textures for ideal crushed tomato consistency. Tomato preservation is a task best shared with family or friends, but if working on your own, you will still end the day in a kind of exhausted glory and with a pantry full of summer’s bounty. [Canning basics: What you need to get started] Troubleshooting: Never add anything except lemon juice or citric acid and salt to the jar. Adding meat, garlic, mushrooms, peppers, onions, herbs or spices will alter the pH and will render the contents dangerous for consumption. After processing, if the tomato water and pulp separate in the jar, the liquid rising to the top, the tomatoes were not crushed enough or were added to the pot too quickly. It does not affect the taste or the shelf-stability at all. Shake the jar before using. Any tiny amount of food left on the rim of the jar before placing the lid can interfere with the seal. Clean the jars meticulously before covering. Do not move the jars from the water-bath canner too quickly. Allow them to rest in the canner for 10 minutes to slow the boiling inside the jar. Vigorous boiling can trigger siphoning; the contents may bubble up and lift the lid, breaking the seal. After processing, any jars with failed seals should be refrigerated and used within 2 weeks. Canned Crushed Tomatoes Almost any tomato can be canned, but meaty types such as Brandywine, Beefsteak, Big Red and Roma varieties are preferred. Storage: The jars can be stored in a cool, dark place for up to 18 months. Where to buy: Canning supplies are available at hardware stores, groceries and online.   Ingredients 25 pounds ripe but firm tomatoes (about 30 to 45, depending on size, see headnote) About 4 teaspoons (28 grams) citric acid or 1 cup (240 milliliters) bottled lemon juice Kosher or fine sea salt (optional)   Steps Step 1 Set up for water-bath canning (see related recipe). Fill the largest bowl in your kitchen or a 15-quart capacity cooler with ice water. Set up 2 large bowls: One for the tomato cores, peels and seeds and the other for the crushed tomatoes. Step 2 Bring a large pot of water to a boil over high heat and reduce the heat so the water is at a steady simmer. Slice an X just through the skin at the bottom of each tomato. Gently slide a few tomatoes at a time into the boiling water for 30 to 60 seconds (depending on the size and ripeness of the tomato). Step 3 Continue with the remaining tomatoes, letting the water return to a steady simmer between batches and blanching a few tomatoes at a time. The tomatoes will float to the surface at about the same time the peel has loosened. As they bob up, use a slotted spoon to transfer them to the ice bath to stop the cooking. Step 4 Working over one large bowl, core and remove the peel from the tomatoes. Cut out any bruises or black spots. Halve the tomatoes and, using your fingers, scoop out and discard the seeds and gel. Crush and tear the tomato flesh into the other large bowl. Step 5 Begin multitasking. When about a quart of torn tomato pieces are in the large bowl, use both hands to smash and squeeze them. As the tomatoes break down, they will separate into a watery soup with larger pieces of pulp. The more the tomatoes are massaged and the solid and watery textures combined at this step, the less likely the contents of the jars will separate into tomatoes and liquid after processing. Step 6 It is easier to reach the correct consistency by working in smaller batches. When you have about 4 cups of crushed tomatoes in the bowl, add them to an 8-quart or larger nonreactive pot and bring to a boil, breaking down the tomatoes further with a potato masher or strong wooden spoon. Reduce to a strong simmer and continue to hand-crush tomatoes in the large bowl and add them, 4 cups at a time, to the tomatoes in the pot, returning the mixture to a boil between additions. (Keep count of the 4-cup additions and prepare the number of jars needed: 4 cups is equivalent to 1 quart or 2 pints.) When all the tomatoes have been added to the pot, bring the entire batch to a rolling boil for 5 minutes, stirring continually. Step 7 Ladle the hot crushed tomatoes into the prepared jars, leaving a 1-inch headspace (that is, an inch between the rim/underside of the lid and the food or liquid in the jar). Add 1/2 teaspoon citric acid or 2 tablespoons lemon juice to each quart jar. (Add 1/4 teaspoon citric acid or 1 tablespoon lemon juice to each pint jar.) If using salt, add 1 teaspoon per quart jar or 1/2 teaspoon to each pint jar. Using a chopstick or a similar tool, stir the contents of each jar, releasing any air bubbles. Before sealing the jar, double-check that a 1/2-inch of headspace remains, adding a bit more tomato if needed. Step 8 Carefully clean the rims and threads of each jar with a damp paper towel. Check the rim with your fingertip dipped in white vinegar: It should be squeaky-clean. Place the lids and rings on the jars and finger-tighten the rings. Step 9 Process in a boiling water bath for 45 minutes if using quart jars, 35 minutes if using pint jars. If processing both sizes of jars, boil for the full 45 minutes. Let the jars rest in the canner for 10 minutes to help prevent siphoning (when the boiling ingredients bubble up under the lid, breaking the seal). Using a jar-lifter, lift the jars from the canner, keeping them upright, and place on a towel-lined baking sheet. (Do not use kitchen tongs to lift the jars.) Do not move the jars for several hours. Step 10 When thoroughly cool, remove the rings and test the seal by lifting the jar by the flat lid. If it has not sealed, and only within 24 hours of the original processing, reheat the tomatoes and reprocess as before, including adding more citric acid or lemon juice. If the seal fails after 24 hours, or in the days and months following, discard the tomatoes. Wash and dry the sealed jars, label and date them and store in a dark, cool place for up to 18 months. Altitude adjusting: Because water boils at lower temperatures at higher altitudes, processing times should be increased to reach a safe temperature. From 1,000 to 2,999 feet above sea level, add 5 minutes. At 3,000 to 5,999 feet above sea level, add 10 minutes. At 6,000 to 7,999 feet above sea level, add 15 minutes. At 8,000 to 10,000 feet above sea level, add 20 minutes. From food writer Cathy Barrow. Tested by Ann Maloney; email questions to voraciously@washpost.com.

1c168b788f47ba9f2a42d1c57f3c5949,Dreamlike photos of Appalachia in the 1970s,"    Ruby Cornett's “I asked my sister to take a picture of me on Easter morning,'"" from “Portraits and Dreams” by Wendy Ewald. (Courtesy of the artist and Mack)            By  Kenneth Dickerman          Kenneth Dickerman Photo editor  Email  Bio        Photo Editor  August 28    For the past 20 years, I have immersed myself in the history of photography. I know quite a bit about what has been done. But I’m not so naive as to believe that I know it all. That’s the one thing that has kept me engaged and passionate about photography — the understanding that there is always some body of work somewhere around the corner that will make things seem new to me again. This is precisely what happened when I learned of an updated version of a book I didn’t know existed — Wendy Ewald’s “Portraits and Dreams: Photographs and Stories by Children of the Appalachians.” It’s just been republished by Mack publishing house, and it’s fascinating. Ewald moved to Kentucky in February 1976. Just 25 years old, she was keen on getting to know her new home and neighbors. She wanted to capture her new surroundings, to create a document that “had the soul and rhythm of the place.” But she felt that her own camera was getting in the way of doing that. During college, Ewald had taught photography to First Nations children, and her new home seemed like the perfect opportunity to continue that. So, she contacted the principal of the local school and eventually began teaching the children of Letcher County how to take pictures. For the next few years, it is what she did. The results, compiled into “Portraits and Dreams,” are extraordinary. Far from being merely descriptive of the place where they live, the photographs give us an intimate look inside the children’s minds. This was accomplished partly because Ewald asked the children to photograph their dreams. So, many of the photos in the book depict the children’s rich inner lives. The exercises Ewald had the children do with their cameras resulted in photos depicting both the whimsical and the sinister. Each of these can be seen in photos such as Denise Dixon’s “Self-portrait reaching for the Red Star sky,” and Allen Shepherd’s “I dreamt I killed my best friend, Ricky Dixon.” In a lovely introduction to the book, Ben Lifson writes about the photos produced by Ewald’s collaborations with the children from the hollers of Letcher County. Of the photos, Lifson says, “Their world is intimate and still. The places they describe are self-contained; no fragments of details along the edges of the pictures imply connection to a larger world just outside the frame.” Lifson attributes all of this to the guidance of Ewald: “The driving conscience of this work is Wendy Ewald’s. She believed that if left to follow their hearts and pleasures, the children would show us both what they cherished and what their community holds dear.” First published in 1985, Ewald’s original book is very rare, but this new version, with photos and stories by eight of the students from the original publication, brings new life to what is already considered to be a masterpiece.

d14fa690a060a1cdfe5a75814816c60a,Self-driving pods and outdoor terminals: How the pandemic could change U.S. airports," The airport experience has long been synonymous with stress: huge arrival areas, frantic security checkpoints, cramped trams shuttling groups between terminals — with, of course, lines at all of them. And when airports return to normal passenger volumes, the stress of a long line or a crowded terminal will no doubt be exacerbated by the potential presence of the novel coronavirus. A leading airport architecture firm says there must be a better way to organize and transport passengers after the pandemic, and it is already proposing some high-tech options to get there. “Being in confined spaces with others no longer feels comfortable for passengers,” says aviation architect Ty Osbaugh of Gensler, a global firm that has designed many airports, including San Francisco, John F. Kennedy, Los Angeles and South Korea’s Incheon. “Now is an opportunity to think, ‘What do we want the airport experience to be three years from now?’ ” As technologies like coronavirus testing and temperature screenings are being implemented in some U.S. airports, Osbaugh’s team is proposing not just outdoor airport spaces and touchless technologies, but also a whole new way to get around once travelers are health- and security-screened. [What to know about getting tested for the coronavirus to travel] Self-driving ‘pods’ The most abrupt change Gensler is proposing involves “autonomous, individual pods” that transport passengers from outdoor health- and security-screening areas to their gates and, possibly, directly to the aircraft. The design would eliminate walking through an airport full of people and is being proposed for Virginia’s Dulles International Airport, which Osbaugh says is already properly laid out for the individualized transit to work. “The airport experience of land-side and air-side bisected by a series of regulatory processes is not the model of the future,” Osbaugh says. In his vision of a new Dulles that uses personalized pods, “the iconic space of Dulles will become the primary air-side dwell lounge where we wait for our flights. As departure time nears, passengers take autonomous, individual pods to the gates, personally chauffeured to the aircraft.”    (Courtesy of Gensler and DIG)  It might sound like a far-fetched fever dream to board a self-driving pod to your flight, but Osbaugh notes that Heathrow Airport already uses small autonomous vehicles as transit from its business parking garages to terminals. He envisions the one- to four-passenger pods as being sanitized between trips and replacing many airports’ existing tram lines. “There’s no reason you couldn’t do this in lieu of a train system, like what Dulles and the Atlanta airport already have,” Osbaugh says. “I could see a scenario where an airport would mostly be individualized containers.” Immigration self-screenings  The reverse benefit of Gensler’s proposal for curbside-to-gate pods is that arriving planes could shuttle passengers directly to their baggage claim, and those pods could implement a remote customs screening that would take place during the ride. That would mean no lengthy passport control lines, especially for returning citizens whose process wouldn’t require much else than a document check. In May, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security put out a call for research and development opportunities for airport security self-screening technologies — signaling potential intent to automate checkpoints like the Transportation Security Administration’s and Customs and Border Protection’s. Automating the customs process into the pods, Osbaugh says, would mean “passengers are no longer being rushed from one process and queue to another.” Even if all passengers couldn’t complete a remote screening, allowing certain groups would greatly cut down crowds and lines at customs checkpoints. [Plane cabins could change dramatically because of the pandemic. Here’s how.] Outdoor terminals Gensler also recognizes, however, that not all travelers are going to breeze through the airport and onto their flight. A proposed change is to make terminals open-air, or at least accessible to attached, controlled outdoor areas. Terminals that “bleed between inside and outside” will be paramount, Osbaugh says, and similar terminals already exist as a good model. JFK’s Terminal 5 is beloved for its JetBlue Park, which opened as a dog-walk area. Osbaugh envisions something even more modern, however, mentioning courtyard-based layouts similar to Apple’s circular headquarters in Cupertino, Calif., which centers on a behemoth, open-air garden.    Construction on JetBlue's Terminal 5 began in December 2005 and cost $743 million dollars. It more than doubled the airlines' passenger capacity to 20 million annually. (Mark Greenberg/JetBlue Airways)  Touchless biometric screening As touchless technologies expand, Osbaugh sees biometric screening, also known as facial recognition technology, emerging as the new security screening and even the new boarding pass. “Your face is your ticket. No fumbling for tickets, no handing over passport documents,” he says. Airports around the globe have already begun to invest in facial recognition scans as a means of quickly processing passengers, but in the United States it has been met with questions about whether it is accurate, especially as studies show that it consistently misidentifies people of color. Wearing a mask can also throw off the technology. All of these changes are costly, but Osbaugh says that airports will probably be focused on making passengers comfortable with air travel once again to get them back. Even as airports see lower profits because of reduced travel, now is the time to take advantage of the absence of crowds and invest ahead of a broader return to traveling. It’s entirely possible that the sooner airports built up newly comfortable infrastructure, the sooner that return will come. “Every projection I’ve seen says airport traffic will rebound to pre-covid levels in 2022 or 2023. Why not build when passenger volumes are down?” Osbaugh says. “It has to be safe, and when it is, travel will come back.” Read more: The State Dept. lifted its blanket international travel advisory.

514c0d52d81ad6a31844e325c7fcbc38,Luscious tomato jam dresses up fried egg and crispy prosciutto toasts," Overview Ingredients Steps  Overview It’s that time of year again, tomato season, when I spend ample time devouring and writing about the glorious vegetable, and then wait for the emails and DMs telling me I should know a tomato is actually a fruit. [Just a pinch of saffron turns this pasta with cod into pure gold] It’s true, a tomato is technically a fruit from a botanical perspective. Its seeds make it so — and by that definition peppers, cucumbers and squash are fruits, too. But from a nutritional and culinary point of view, tomatoes (and peppers, cucumbers and squash) are rightly classified as vegetables because of their nutrient makeup and the way they are typically used in the kitchen. The Supreme Court even ruled tomatoes a vegetable in an 1893 case. This recipe plays with that fruit-vegetable paradigm, teasing out tomatoes’ inherent sweet-savory essence by turning them into a luscious jam. It’s simple to make, and a wonderful way to use up a batch that is threatening toward overripe: Just seed, chop and put them in a pot with a little honey, vinegar, salt and pepper to simmer for about an hour, until the tomatoes are broken down and reduced to a thick, spreadable jam. (I don’t bother to skin the tomatoes first because I don’t mind the textured bits in the finished product, but feel free to do so if you want a smoother jam.) The jam works in myriad ways: Transforming a grilled cheese sandwich, or any sandwich, really; as an elegant and surprising addition to a cheese plate; dolloped onto yogurt for a savory finish or as a topping for a grain bowl, to name a handful. In the accompanying recipe, the jewel-red tomato jam is spread onto crusty whole-grain toast, then topped with a fried egg and treated to a sprinkle of pan-crisped prosciutto. The saltiness of the cured ham balances the gentle sweetness of the tomato spread, and the egg makes the dish a satisfying foundation for a meal. I like to serve it alongside a bowl of chilled vegetable soup or a garden salad. Scale and get a printer-friendly version of the recipe here. Whatever you call it — fruit or vegetable — versatile tomatoes make a pretty fabulous jam. Storage: The recipe makes about 2 cups of the tomato jam; you’ll need 3/4 cup of it for this recipe. The jam may be refrigerated in an airtight container for up to 2 weeks. Serve it chilled, warm or at room temperature.   Ingredients 2 pounds ripe plum tomatoes (7 to 8 large), cored, seeded and chopped 2 tablespoons honey 2 tablespoons cider vinegar 1/4 teaspoon kosher salt, plus more to taste 1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper, plus more to taste 2 ounces sliced prosciutto (4 slices) 3 teaspoons olive oil, divided 4 large eggs 4 large slices whole grain, crusty bread (1 1/4 ounces each), toasted   Steps Step 1 To make the tomato jam, in a medium pot, combine the tomatoes, honey, vinegar and 1/4 teaspoon each of the salt and pepper. Set the pot over medium-high heat and bring to a boil. Lower the heat to medium-low and cook, uncovered, adjusting the heat as needed to keep the mixture at a simmer. Stir occasionally, until the tomatoes have broken down and the mixture has become thick and jam-like, 60 to 70 minutes. (Once the mixture starts to thicken, you may need to stir more frequently to prevent scorching.) Remove from the heat, let cool until warm, and transfer to a pint-size jar or 2-cup lidded container. If not using the jam right away, refrigerate it for up to 2 weeks. Step 2 To make the toasts, slice or tear the prosciutto lengthwise into 1/2-inch wide strips. In a medium nonstick skillet over medium-high heat, heat 1 teaspoon of the oil until shimmering. Add the prosciutto strips and cook, stirring frequently, until the prosciutto is crisped, about 5 minutes, then transfer to a plate. Step 3 Return the skillet to medium-high heat and heat the remaining 2 teaspoons of oil until shimmering. Add the eggs and cook until sunny-side up or over-easy, as desired. Step 4 Spread about 3 tablespoons of the jam over a piece of toast, top each with an egg, and finish with some crispy prosciutto. Season to taste with additional salt and pepper, if desired.

Email  Bio  Follow         Tim Meko          Tim Meko Deputy graphics director  Email  Bio  Follow         August 28  One indication of how destructive the past two weeks have been in California lies in the terminology the state firefighting agency uses to refer to what has happened. CalFire refers to the period since Aug. 15 as a “fire siege,” a term that might otherwise be used in warfare, but it’s appropriate considering two of the state’s top 5 largest fires on record began and reached record sizes during this time frame. The blazes are still burning, harming air quality and human health, but they’re no longer prompting urgent evacuations. In fact, residents are being allowed back into some areas as the state shifts from crisis mode to containment and recovery. However, the most dangerous part of the Southern California wildfire season still awaits in October and November, with more months of fire risks in Central and Northern California as well. [Why California's wildfires are so intense right now] Blazing heat, extreme dryness and a dry lightning outbreak Two indexes fire forecasters use to gauge the risk of rapid fire spread were at or near record levels for Central and Northern California at the time the blazes broke out. One of these indexes is known as the vapor pressure deficit, which is a proxy for how quickly vegetation dries out, and the other being the Evaporative Demand Drought Index, or EDDI, which measures the thirst of the atmosphere. These indexes showed that the region was primed for burning if the right trigger came along.

The heat helped dry out already parched vegetation, providing ample fuel for fires once they got going. In addition, gusty winds helped spark extreme fire behavior, including a verified fire tornado Aug. 15 in Lassen County.
